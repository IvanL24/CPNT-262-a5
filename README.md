# Notes
  - I faced different kind of problems with this assignment which taught me that a just missing a letter, comma or backticks can ruin the entire website.
  - Also when I copied and paste the `assets` folder from `_source` into the `public` folder on vs code the css was not read by the ejs, but when I copied and paste it using file explorer it works totally fine. I am not sure if this happens to other students as well or is it something to do with HTML5UP.
